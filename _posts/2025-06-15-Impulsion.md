In order for something to be, there should be nothing at first. To find impulsion, one must not seek it, but rather comprehend the virtue behind nothingness or idleness. To not do anything and to be fully content. This contradict the feeling of incompleteness that we are mostly occupied with.
As of any action, there must be some kind of a reward or an impulse that makes us behave in a certain way. With nothingness it’s different matter. What drives someone to repulse certain type of food ? For someone who’s been eating sugar for some time it could be tough to quit. And knowing sugar is unhealthy isn’t motivating either. One feels encouraged and aroused by change ones the little changes shows effect; more energy and mood stability in the case of sugar. 

We must understand first what it means to be content with nothingness.
Nothingness is the norm.
It’s the state in which we were born and how most of our youth was spent. 

conditions to reach nothingness state

State of being as kids for nothingness to emerge.
1- there wasn’t a question behind our motive. (Driven by curiosity)
2- we could enjoy silly things.
3- creativity and imagination were the dominant states. (Most time experimenting)
4- entitlement to existing and potential.
5- lack of fear , and total feeling of privacy (not programed yet to project people’s feeling)

===> Most of these conditions aren’t present in nowadays life. We are constantly seeking self improvement for the sake of improvement, but in fact the motivation here is the lack of inner value and the sense of incompleteness.    

« Nothingness » paradoxically gives what we seek through stopping our desire to be guided by detracting motivation.

Set of principles to abolish the old habit of desire:
1- value is inward.
2- remain genuine with not knowing and confusion.
If I desire something, I built a story and so I become labeled by that story. For sex there is a story labeled with romance. Losing a fight and accepting  honor death  prevents the ego from completely getting squashed . I always have an explanation of every desire. Even I look for the explanation before having desire at times.
