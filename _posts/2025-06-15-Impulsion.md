![state of nothingness with pure impulses floating around the soul- generated by DALL·E 3](/assets/emerginglight_child.png)

In order for something to be, there should be nothing at first. To find impulsion, one must not seek it, but rather comprehend the virtue behind nothingness or idleness. To not do anything and to be fully content. This contradict the feeling of incompleteness that we are mostly occupied with.

Mostly, each impulse has a cause. Every action has an explantion. the food we eat, the things we watch and everything we consume pops up towards the conscious level. amid too many arousales, the question is what happens we take off the noise ? when is the impulse legit ? (genuine and serves us best).

Impusion is a broad term. it could describe the action toward anything.

I'm more concern with the kind that makes us live in an active state. a state that is not passive or obdient to external stimuli. This state is filled with energy (fuel action) and playfullness (creativity).

Paradoxically, such impulsion works best when we are in a state of peace. the moment of slowing the pace of things and observe our surrounding. However, an important element that pushes the emergence of such state is "nothingness". Nothingness is everyone who could enjoy leasure (free time). One who could relaxes and understand the no obligation to be something forcefully.

### We must understand first what it means to be content with nothingness.

-> Chatgpt said : be content with nothingness often means finding peace, acceptance, or even fulfillment in the absence of things.

-> However I would describe it as:
   - Nothingness is the norm.
   - It’s the state in which we were born and how most of our youth was spent. Often bounded by bordom.

### Conditions to reach nothingness state

State of being as kids for nothingness to emerge.
1. there wasn’t a question behind our motive. (Driven by curiosity)
2. we could enjoy silly things.
3. creativity and imagination were the dominant states. (Most time experimenting)
4. entitlement to existing and potential.
5. lack of fear , and total feeling of privacy (not programed yet to project people’s feeling)

> Most of these conditions aren’t present in nowadays life. We are constantly seeking self improvement for the sake of improvement, but in fact the motivation here is the lack of inner value and the sense of incompleteness.    

> « Nothingness » paradoxically gives what we seek through stopping our desire to be guided by detracting motivation.

### Set of principles to abolish the old habit of desire:
1. value is inward.
2. remain genuine with not knowing and confusion.

If one desires something, they build a story.
